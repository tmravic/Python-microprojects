# - The 1-2-3 Game
This is a little game I made to practice the basics of Python logic. You have 5 HP and you try to guess the correct number between 1 and 3 a certain number of times. You can open this in Python 3.x or the shell.

# - Cryptography
You can input a message and a number less than 26, and this program will generate a secret code for you.
